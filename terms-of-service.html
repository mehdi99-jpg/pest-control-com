        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Home Shield, its employees, and contractors from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your failure to follow our instructions or recommendations, or from any misrepresentation of the condition of your property.</p>
